# Formula for the TaskRatchet CLI.
#
# Binaries are pre-built Go executables published by the `Release CLI` workflow
# in the private taskratchet monorepo; they land as GitHub release assets on
# PinePeakDigital/taskratchet-cli-releases. Nothing is compiled here.
#
# This file is machine-updated: release-cli.yml rewrites the version, the four
# sha256 values and the tag in each URL on every CLI release. Keep the marker
# comments intact — the update step keys on them.

      The TaskRatchet CLI is alpha. Commands, flags and output format may change
      between releases. Pin a version if you script against it.
